\section*{Conclusion}

In this report, we study Robust PCA with respect to its theory, algorithms and applications.

In the theory part, we focus our discussion on the the details of the proof of the probabilistic guarantee of recovery of a low rank matrix corrupted from sparse noise via a convex optimization involving a heuristic of minimizing~$\ell_1$-norm and nuclear norm. Then, we  survey different existing variants and generalization of Robust PCA. Finally, we extend and analyze the robust PCA framework on problems where the rank of the low rank component is known.   

In the algorithm part, we survey different algorithms to implement the Robust PCA. Then we compare their theoretical complexity and convergence rate on synthetic data. We remark that the bottleneck to the algorithm lies on the computation of SVD of matrix. Regarding this, we have studied various methods to alleviate this bottleneck. 

In the application part, we apply Robust PCA to several problem domains. We apply it to extract the background from video frames, to extract a speech corrupted by background noise, to analyze correlation of votes for candidates in senator voting and to separate sparse noise in neural spike data. 

To summarize, Robust PCA is a powerful tool to recover low-rank matrix from sparse noise. It has strong performance guarantee, can be implemented by efficient algorithms, and can be applied to solve many real life problems.
